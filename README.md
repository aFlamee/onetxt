# OneTXT - Directory to Text Converter

I created OneTXT to make coding with an LLM much easier. When you provide an AI with the full source code of a project, you can get way better answers and suggestions. But manually gathering all files? Ainâ€™t nobody got time for that! And thatâ€™s where OneTXT comes in.

OneTXT is an open-source tool that converts directory structures into readable text output while respecting ignore rules (e.g., `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`). It features a GUI for ease of use and supports predefined presets for popular frameworks like SvelteKit, Next.js, React, Django and more.

## Features

- **GUI-Based**: Simple and intuitive interface for selecting directories and configuring ignore rules.
- **Ignore Patterns**: Supports `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, and custom ignore rules.
- **Predefined Presets**: Quick setup for popular frameworks (React, Next.js, Django, etc.).
- **Text Output**: Converts file content into a single text file (`response.txt`).
- **Multi-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

### Download the Executable (Recommended for Non-IT Users)

If you're a normal user who just wants to click a button and let magic happen, you can download the latest **OneTXT.exe** from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onetxt/releases) section and run it directly on Windows.

âš  **Security Warning**: Your OS might panic and yell at you about an "untrusted application". This is just because the app is **not digitally signed**â€”not because itâ€™s dangerous. Signing costs money, and guess what? Iâ€™d rather spend that on coffee. If you trust me, just run the app. If not, feel free to check out the code and run it manually (see below).

### Manual Installation (For Developers & Advanced Users)

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (Make sure `tkinter` is installed)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aFlamee/onetxt.git
cd onetxt
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python -m onetxt
```

This will launch the graphical interface. Boom. Simple.

## Usage

### 1. Select a Directory

Pick a folder that contains the files you want to process.

### 2. Configure Ignore Rules

- **Use .gitignore/.dockerignore**: Because sometimes, you just donâ€™t want all files.
- **Presets**: Got a React or Django project? One click, and weâ€™ll handle the boring stuff for you.
- **Custom Ignores**: Add additional files/folders to ignore. Because customization is life.

### 3. Run the Script

Click the **Generate txt** button to process the directory. The output will be saved as `response.txt`Â in the directory you just read from.&#x20;

Yes, it's that easy.

### 4. Output Handling

Once the process is complete, you can:

- **Open response.txt** (To go directly to your favorit LLM afterwards)
- **Copy its content to clipboard**
- **Open it in VSCode** (for all the fancy devs out there)
